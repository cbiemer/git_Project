Folders for inside of node_modules contain mandatory information for running the server and site.
If they are corrupted delete then and type:
	npm install {folder name}
			or
	npm install -g {folder name}
to re-install the corrupted module. 

If any of the files are missing, email me and I will respond as quickly as possible with the 
missing file.

to run:
	1. Open three command prompts
		Command prompt 1:
			1. Type: mongod
		Command prompt 2:
			1. Go to base directory of this project.
				- Base directory is where this file is int
			2. Type: node server.js
		Command prompt 3:
			1. Go to base directory of this project.
				- Base directory is where this file is int
			2. Type: gulp
				- This will generate the dist directory, which is what will actual be called
				  when you go to the website which is explained below.
	2. Open browser, preferably chrome, and go to: localhost:3000
	3. Enjoy!

Note instructions are based on the assumption you have used mongodb and node.js before.
If you have not go to there resepctive sites:
	https://nodejs.org/
	https://www.mongodb.org/
and download the correct version. Afterwhich, make sure to set up path variables inside of your
environment so you can type mongod, instead of /bin/mongod (for example).

Notes on adding more in the future:
	For developing and running on commpand prompt 3 add one more command: gulp watch which will
	auto-browserify your code for you and place inside of the dist directory everytime you save.

	Postman, a google chrome extension, is extremely useful for testing out responses to your get
	and post requests before putting them on the website.

	Info and Stat buttons do in fact go to the same exact page, because the server will format the
	data the exact same way. The only difference is what data the page is receiving.

	Everything starts with main.js and goes to app.js. Start reading from app.js, but know tht the 
	app.js is rendering to main.js which will then place into the div inside of index.html.
